  "description": "_Built for Dynamo 1.3_ Graphical is a very work in progress package that aims to provide some general methods from graph theory, algorithms and pretty much any topic I can find interesting and viable to implement in Dynamo. Currently provides methods to generate Visibility Graphs with which shortest path can be calculated, plus some other geometry helpers. More to come (hopefully!). It is built for Dynamo 1.3, but I've tried on Dynamo Sandbox 2.0 and works just fine. For more information check https://github.com/alvpickmans/GraphicalDynamo ",
