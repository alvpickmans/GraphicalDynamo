  "description": "_Built for Dynamo 1.3_ Graphical is a very work in progress package that aims to provide some general methods from graph theory, algorithms and pretty much any topic I can find interesting and viable to implement in Dynamo.\r\nCurrently provides methods to generate Visibility Graphs with which shortest path can be calculated, plus some other geometry helpers. More to come (hopefully!). It is built for Dynamo 1.3, but it should work fine for 2.0 for now. For more information check https://github.com/alvpickmans/GraphicalDynamo",
